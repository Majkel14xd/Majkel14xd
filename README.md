# Michał Lidwa

## Wordpress Developer and IT Specialist

Hi! in my GitHub profile! My name is Michał and I am an IT enthusiast with a special interest in four key areas: IT administration, computer networks, cybersecurity, and computer system management. 

For over a year, I have been working as a freelancer, creating and maintaining WordPress websites, which has allowed me to gain practical experience in server administration, hosting service configuration, and web application security.

I have completed a number of Cisco CCNA (v7) courses, expanding my knowledge of designing and securing LAN/WAN networks, configuring Cisco network devices, and analyzing network traffic.

I also deal with cybersecurity – I conduct penetration tests, analyze logs, detect vulnerabilities, and secure systems against threats (Burp Suite, Kali Linux, Wireshark, Nmap).

Additionally, I have experience in managing Windows, Linux, and Windows Server (Active Directory) systems, as well as virtualization environments.
